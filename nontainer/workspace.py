"""Workspace: the top-level API. One instance == one session's world.

Design notes (see README "Design decisions"):

- **Script model.** ``run_python`` is a fresh sandboxed execution per
  call; persistence lives in ``cache`` (data), ``helpers/`` (code, via
  VFS imports), and files (artifacts). No resident interpreter state.
- **Sync core.** termish and kvgit are synchronous (sandtrap is NOT
  the constraint — it has ``aexec()``); async harnesses wrap calls in
  ``asyncio.to_thread`` (the adapters do this). A workspace is
  single-writer and enforces it: mutating calls hold an internal
  ``RLock``, so a harness that threads parallel tool calls onto one
  session serializes safely (each call atomic + checkpointed) instead
  of corrupting staged state. Read-only accessors don't take the
  lock. Open question for v1.x: an ``arun_python`` passing through to
  sandtrap ``aexec`` would let *agent code* use top-level ``await``
  (parallel host-object calls) — but it would still not be
  host-loop-safe end-to-end, since sandboxed file I/O hits sync kvgit
  under monkeyfs; async harnesses off-loop the call regardless.
- **Observations are bounded.** Tool results are truncated to
  ``max_observation`` characters with an explicit ``truncated`` flag —
  agents handle "output was cut" far better than silent loss or a
  blown context window.
- **cwd is stateful** across calls (like any other mutating terminal
  command) and persists via the ``__cwd__`` framework key in kv, so
  on versioned providers rollback also restores *where you were*.
- **Execution is a seam.** How code runs — the python sandbox, the
  shell, worker lifecycle — lives behind :class:`Executor` (see
  executor.py); the default :class:`LocalExecutor` is the in-process
  sandtrap + termish wiring. The workspace keeps what execution must
  not own: the lock, the checkpoint flow, cwd, the cache key rules.

    """Build a session's :class:`Workspace` (the one-liner entry point).

    Session resolution by backend:

    - ``"kvgit"``: one shared store at ``store`` (default
      ``~/.nontainer``); ``session`` is a branch. Forks share storage.
    - ``"dir"``: ``store/<session>/`` as a plain directory
      (``IsolatedFS``). No versioning; time-travel verbs raise.
    - ``"agentfs"``: ``store/<session>.db``, one AgentFS file per
      session (unversioned spike).

    ``provider`` overrides ``backend``/``store`` entirely (bring your
    own substrate). ``session`` is validated against ``SESSION_ID_RE``
    in all paths.

    ``executor_factory`` selects the execution backend for this session
    and every fork of it (default: the in-process ``LocalExecutor``).
    Pass ``lambda: DudExecutor()`` to run on a real machine — see
    ``nontainer.executor_dud`` and its ``[dud]`` extra.
